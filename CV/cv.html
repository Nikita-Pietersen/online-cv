	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Nikita Pietersen. I am a 19 year old female that matricualted from Rylands High School in the year 2018.<br>
		My hobbies include reading, gaming, playing sports and coding. <br>
		My aspirations are to become a web developer and in the next 5 years to be a senior  developer.<br>
		If I am unable to become a senior developer in five years, I'd still work towards that goal as it is an important goal I've set for myself.<br>
		I enjoy learning new langugaes and the fun ways that I am able to implement them.<br>
		I enjoy designing web pages and making the pages look lively and aesthetically pleasing.<br>
		My favourites languages are HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>
		I favour challenges that I know will require dedication and proper time management.<br>
		I am the type of person that will push myself to learn as much as I can as I work.<br>

		<h2>Duties</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				At Checkers as a till packer, it was my duty to pack the customers groceries,<br> as well as finding the correct product for the customer should they come to the till unsure of the product they have chosen.<br> I needed to have excellent communication skills for this job due to having a language barrier with some of the customers.<br>
				After hours it would be my responsibility to clear any tills of whatever products might have been left there.<br>I'd have to refill the stands by the tills with stock as well as the mini fridges.<br> The reason for my resignation was due to the fact that I had the opportunity to study coding through Co Grammar at Life Choices Academy.

				Volunteering at Sarah Fox Children's Home included watching the children during their play time.<br>
				Once the children were taken for their naps I'd have to pack away the toys in the play area and make sure all the surfaces and floors are cleaned of any wet substances and/or food.<br>
